A machine learning model is a mathematical or computational representation that is created by a machine learning algorithm through a training process. 

It is designed to learn patterns and relationships in data, and then make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data based on that learned knowledge.

##### There are some examples of ML Models:

1. **[[Linear Regression Model]]**:
	It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.
	
	This model is often used for tasks such as predicting housing prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, etc.
