Parameters in a language model represent the **learned variables** that enable the model to comprehend and generate text.

In the context of large language models like [[Introducing LLaMA|LLaMA]], the number of parameters serves as a measure of the **model's complexity** and **capacity to learn** from data.

The number of parameters in a language model is determined by factors such as the model's architecture, depth, width, and the size of the training data. The number of parameters indicates the scale and intricacy of the model, with larger models potentially offering heightened performance at the cost of increased computational requirements.
