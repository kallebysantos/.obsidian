Fine-tuning is a process in machine learning where a pre-trained [[Machine Learn Models|model]] is further **adapted** or **customized** to perform a specific task or address a specific domain, such as answering questions about a particular topic or recommending products that are relevant to a given query. 

Instead of [[Training Models|training]] a model from scratch, fine-tuning **leverages** the knowledge and representations learned from a pre-existing model resulting in an adapted **new model**. I allows a faster and more efficient way for train on task-specific data.

##### Fine-Tuning steps:
1. **Pre-Training**:
	Initially, a large-scale language model, such as [[Introducing LLaMA|LLaMA]], is 
	**pre-trained** on a vast corpus of unlabeled text data.
	
	During pre-training, the model **learns to understand** and generate text by **predicting** missing words or **next-word probabilities** based on the surrounding context. This pre-training phase imparts general language understanding to the model.
	
2. **Task Definition**:
	After pre-training, the next step is to define the specific task or domain for which the model will be fine-tuned. 
	
	This could involve tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, text classification, or machine translation, among others.
	
3. **Data Collection**:
	Task-specific labeled or annotated data is collected or generated for fine-tuning.
	
	This data should be representative of the target task and should include examples with ground truth labels or annotations.
	
4. **Model Initialization**:
	The pre-trained model, such as [[Introducing LLaMA|LLaMA]], serves as the **starting point**. The parameters and representations learned during pre-training form the initial state of the model for fine-tuning.
	
5. **Architecture Modification**:
	Depending on the task, modifications may be made to the model's architecture. 
	
	This could involve adding task-specific layers, adjusting the number of layers or units, or applying additional techniques like attention mechanisms or pooling operations.
	
6. **Fine-tuning Process**:
	The pre-trained model is then trained on the task-specific data. 
	
	The training involves feeding the labeled examples into the model and adjusting the model's [[parameters]] through an optimization algorithm, such as [stochastic gradient descent (SGD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent) , to minimize the loss function specific to the task.
	
	This involves feeding the input data into the model and adjusting its parameters through SGD.
	
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
	Fine-tuning also involves tuning hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization techniques, to optimize the model's performance on the specific task. 
	 
	Hyperparameter tuning ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
	 
8. **Evaluation and Iteration**:
	Throughout the fine-tuning process, the model's performance is evaluated on a separate validation or development set.
	
	This evaluation helps in assessing the model's progress, identifying areas for improvement, and making necessary adjustments. Iteration may involve retraining the model with different hyperparameters or modifying the architecture.
