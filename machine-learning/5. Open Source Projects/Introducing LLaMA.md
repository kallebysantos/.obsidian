LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a foundational large language model [released by Meta](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai). It is designed to facilitate research in the field of AI by providing access to study and explore large language models without requiring extensive infrastructure, promoting accessibility and democratization in the field.

LLaMA is available in multiple sizes, ranging from 7B to 65B [[Parameters|parameters]].
It is trained on a large set of unlabeled data, making it suitable for [[Fine-Tuning|fine-tuning]] and [[Adapters|adaptation]] to various tasks. The model can be utilized to validate existing work, test new approaches, and explore different use cases within [[Natural Language Processing]] and AI.

Large language models like LLaMA have shown significant potential in generating text, solving complex problems, and answering questions across domains. However, due to the resource-intensive nature of these models, access to them has been limited, hindering progress in understanding their workings and addressing issues such as bias, toxicity, and misinformation generation.

By releasing LLaMA, Meta aims to enable researchers to more easily experiment with and investigate large language models. The model is designed to be versatile, applicable to a wide range of tasks and use cases. Researchers can use LLaMA as a foundational model for their own research, [[Fine-Tuning a model for specific task|fine-tune it for specific applications]], and test approaches to mitigate issues such as bias and toxicity.
